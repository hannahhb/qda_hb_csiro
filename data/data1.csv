The way in which they were going to integrate telehealth into their practices varied. A selection of illustrative quotes from clinicians are in Table 3. Some were enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue include telehealth in their practice. Others reflected on the need to use a balance of telehealth and face-to-face consultations, or on the need to use it selectively. For others, it was easily integrated into their existing practice, provided the logistics were addressed.",Enabler,Individuals,D. Motivation
