Another advantage was greater access to RACF-based patients during the GP\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s normal in-clinic workday, as the time normally spent commuting to the RACF could be spared for clinical activities instead. This was especially helpful for those facilities that allowed GPs to access their electronic systems and that had staff available to help facilitate telehealth calls. \"I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to walk into an aged care facility and bring it [COVID-19] in and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want me to come in, so the more that we can do by telehealth lowers their risk, and that includes things that need face to face, so you know they send me lots of wound photos; they send me lots of stuff that we can do. A lot of them have electronic drug charts now, so I can do everything externally; I have access to their notes externally so I don't have to go in.

The way in which they were going to integrate telehealth into their practices varied. A selection of illustrative quotes from clinicians are in Table 3. Some were enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue include telehealth in their practice. Others reflected on the need to use a balance of telehealth and face-to-face consultations, or on the need to use it selectively. For others, it was easily integrated into their existing practice, provided the logistics were addressed.",
