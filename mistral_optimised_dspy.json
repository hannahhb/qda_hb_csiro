In addition, the flexibility ofthe guidelines around the referral mechanismand multimodal service delivery (i.e. the ability to combine telephone and face-to-face) was considered to facilitate the T-CBT pilot. In particular, allowing mental health professionals and project officers to make decisions about the (T-CBT) mode of service delivery, rather than relying on GPs to suggest T-CBT to consumers, was regarded as beneficial. Furthermore, the need for counselling services to be provided remotely and the fact that the service was embedded within ATAPS were reported to facilitate the pilot. ",
